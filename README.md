## Features

- Easy management of view models' lifecycle
- Automatic handling of initialization and disposal
- Support for view model states like initialising, initialised, busy, and error
- Reactive rebuilding of the widget tree when the view model's state changes
- Access to the build context within view models

## Getting started

To use this package, add `veto` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

### Importing

Import the package into your file:

```dart
import 'package:veto/veto.dart';
```

## Usage

### ViewModelBuilder

The `ViewModelBuilder` widget is the core class responsible for providing a view model to the widget tree and managing its lifecycle.

Use the `ViewModelBuilder` like this:

```dart
ViewModelBuilder<MyViewModel>(
  viewModelBuilder: () => MyViewModel(),
  builder: (context, model) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Veto Example')),
      body: model.isBusy
          ? CircularProgressIndicator()
          : Text('Hello World!'),
    );
  },
)
```

Here, `MyViewModel` extends `BaseViewModel`.

### BaseViewModel

Create your custom view model by extending the `BaseViewModel` class:

```dart
class MyViewModel extends BaseViewModel {
  int _counter = 0;

  int get counter => _counter;

  void incrementCounter() {
    setBusy(true);
    wait(1000).then((_) {
      _counter++;
      setBusy(false);
      rebuild();
    });
  }
}
```

In your view model, you can:

- Define properties and methods
- Access the `context` property (e.g., for navigation)
- Call `rebuild` to rebuild the widget tree
- Use `setBusy` and `setError` to manage the view model state

### ViewModelState

`ViewModelState` is an enumeration that defines the different states a `BaseViewModel` can be in:

- `isInitialising`: The view model is currently initializing
- `isInitialised`: The view model has finished initializing
- `isBusy`: The view model is currently busy (e.g., fetching data)
- `hasError`: The view model has encountered an error

You can use the `ViewModelState` enum to display different UI based on the view model's state:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ViewModelBuilder<MyViewModel>(
    viewModelBuilder: () => MyViewModel(),
    builder: (context, model) {
      Widget? content;
      switch (model.state) {
        case ViewModelState.isInitialising:
          content = CircularProgressIndicator();
          break;
        case ViewModelState.isInitialised:
          content = Text('Hello World!');
          break;
        case ViewModelState.isBusy:
          content = CircularProgressIndicator();
          break;
        case ViewModelState.hasError:
          content = Text('An error occurred');
          break;
      }
      return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Veto Example')),
        body: content,
      );
    },
  );
}
```

---

The entire package has extensive documentation. Reading the `BaseViewModel` class from top to bottom will give you a good idea of the benefits of this package. Also, a good example project, proper unit tests and some widget tests have been added pto illustrate and test the most important features of this package.
